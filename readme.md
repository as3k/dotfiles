# Dotfiles & Dev Env Setup

Welcome to my personal dev setup! This repo holds my go-to configuration for shell, Neovim, and general tooling across macOS and Linux. It’s built for speed, clarity, and zero fuss—whether you’re setting up a fresh machine or just looking to streamline your workflow.

## ✨ What’s Included

- **Zsh** with a curated set of aliases and a slick prompt via [Starship](https://starship.rs/)
- **Neovim** set up with modern essentials: LSP, Treesitter, fuzzy finder, Git tools, Dracula theme, and more
- **NVM** for managing Node.js versions
- Global **Yarn** and **npm** binaries in your `$PATH`
- **Handy CLI aliases** for Git, Docker, network checks, and general productivity
- A **cross-platform setup script** that works on both macOS and Linux



## 🗂 Folder Structure

```
.shell/
├── .zshrc 
├── .zsh/
│   └── zshalias 
├── starship/
│   └── starship.toml
├── nvim/
│   ├── init.lua lazy.nvim
│   └── lazy-lock.json
└── setup.sh
```



## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo:**
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dotfiles.git ~/.shell
  cd ~/.shell
```
2.	Run the setup:
  ```
  bash setup.sh
  ```

This will:

	- Install Zsh, Git, Neovim, Node, and more
	- Set up Starship for a better prompt
	- Back up your existing dotfiles and create symlinks for the new ones
	- 
3.	Reload your terminal config:
  ```
  source ~/.zshrc
  ```

4.	Fire up Neovim and install plugins:
  ```
  nvim
  ```
Then type `:Lazy` and hit enter to complete plugin setup.


## 🛠 Customizing
- Aliases: Add or update .zsh/zshalias with your favorite shortcuts
- Prompt: Adjust the look and feel in starship/starship.toml
- Neovim: Modify plugins, themes, and settings in nvim/init.lua

## 🧠 Heads-Up
- Your current .zshrc and Starship config will be backed up before any changes are made
- Neovim may need a few extra language servers or tools depending on what you’re working on
- Docker users: useful aliases are already built in

## 🧰 Troubleshooting

If something’s off:
- Start by reading the output from setup.sh for clues
- Check docs for Starship, Neovim, or lazy.nvim
- Or just comment things out and go step by step—because hey, dotfiles are meant to be hacked
